## Disqus Comments

Scriptor theme comes with Disqus commenting built-in, you just need to have a Disqus account (create it at [Disqus.com](https://disqus.com/)). To enable commenting, you need to change the default Disqus account shortname "my_disqus_shortname" on line 11 in the **comments.hbs** file located in the partials theme folder (Ghost/content/themes/scriptor/partials).

```
var disqus_shortname = 'my_disqus_shortname';
```

If you wish to disable commenting, just remove the following lines from the **post.hbs** file located in the main theme folder:

```
{{!-- The tag below includes the theme comments - partials/comments.hbs --}}
{{> comments}}
```

## Copyright Information (Footer)
